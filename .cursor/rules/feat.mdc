# Your rule content

1. Use English for coding though Chinese is talking
2. Keep README.md updated when adding new rules
3. Document any major changes or reorganizations
4. Use the Google comment style when writing comments
5. Always add pytest tests when writing new code, and make sure the tests pass
6. Regular review and cleanup of deprecated rules
7. Only make the minimal necessary changes. Do not modify anything beyond fixing bugs unless I explicitly ask for new features.
